# oh-my-zsh-setup

This repo contains all the files necessary to replicate my zsh setup.

## Instructions

1. Install zsh and oh-my-zsh, use `chsh` to change the default terminal to zsh
2. Open up the terminal preferences, change colourschemes to `solarized-dark`
3. Place the `.zshrc` file in your home directory, and at lines 5 and 75, replace my home directory with yours
4. Place both `pure_prompt_setup` and `async` in ~/.oh-my-zsh/functions
